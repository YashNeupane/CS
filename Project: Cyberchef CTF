In this project, I will go through various Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. CTF is a popular format for testing Cybersecurity knowledge and recreational problem solving.

For this CTF, most challenges will use Cyberchef and/or just Google.

Trivia Challenges
👥 Challenge 1:  Honesty is Best Policy
Solution:  Integrity
How to Solve: Google the CIA TRIAD ->” ensuring that information is not altered accidentally or by entities unauthorized to make alterations” is about integrity -> it tells you about integrity.

👥 Challenge 3:  Hostage
Solution:   Ransomware
How to Solve: google “What is this kind of malicious software that will encrypt the files on your hard drive and only provide a decryption key when you pay hackers a hefty fee, usually in cryptocurrency.”?

Reconnaissance Challenges
👥 Challenge 4:  11,185,272
Solution:  12,837,064
How to Solve:  Google “11,185,272” -> found a “http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/math/prime/mersenne.html” -> ctrl f “11185272” -> “whats next?” use that to get next number underneeth.

Cryptography Challenges
👥 Challenge 7:  Shifty
Solution:   PleaseChangeMe
How to Solve: use Open cyberchef -> get ROT13 and put it into bake -> put in the “Qeb mxpptloa fp MibxpbZexkdbJb” -> go up to 29 times or down to 3 times. Both yield the same result. 


👥 Challenge 8:  Encoded Message
Solution:  itgetsharderfromhere
How to Solve: go to cyberchief -> use ROT 13 in the bake -> put in the encoded message in the input -> press the magic wand -> it adds the base 64 to the bake section -> the output comes out as it gets harder from here. 


👥 Challenge 10:  But are there eggs?
Solution:  ABRA CA DABRA
How to Solve: search up “what is the name of the cipher developed by a 17th century lawyer, statesman, and philosopher.” -> use the bacon cypher -> press the magic wand -> it will use encode, decode, decode using different translations.
